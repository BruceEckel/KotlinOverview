### Ceremony makes you feel productive
* Everything in a class, a file for every class
* Plain functions -- who needs them?
* It's just not the same without
```java
public class Foo {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // ...
  }
}
```
* How can I know where the end is without semicolons?
